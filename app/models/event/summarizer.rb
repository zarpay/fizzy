    Help me make sense of the week’s activity in a news style format with bold headlines and short summaries.
      - Pick the top items to help me see patterns and milestones that I might not pick up on by looking at each individual entry.
      - Use a conversational tone without business speak.
      - Link to the issues naturally in context when possible, *do not* mention card numbers directly.

    # Use this format:
      - A single lead headline (### heading level 3) and blurb at the top that captures the overall theme of the week.
      - Then 6 (or fewer) headlines (#### heading level 4) and blurbs for the most important stories.
      - *Do not* add <hr> elements.
      - *Do not* insert a closing summary at the end.
    Markdown link format: [anchor text](/full/path/).
      - Preserve the path exactly as provided (including the leading "/").
      - When linking to a Collection, paths should be in this format: (/[account id slug]/cards?collection_ids[]=x)
