This is a Rails engine that [37signals](https://37signals.com/) bundles with [Fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) to offer the SaaS service at https://fizzy.do.

## Working locally in SaaS mode

To make Fizzy run in SaaS mode, run this in the terminal:

```ruby
bin/rails saas:enable
```

To can go back to open source mode:

```ruby
bin/rails saas:disable
```

Then you can work do [Fizzy development as usual](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy).

## Environments

Fizzy is deployed with Kamal. You'll need to have the 1Password CLI set up in order to access the secrets that are used when deploying. Provided you have that, it should be as simple as `bin/kamal deploy` to the correct environment.
